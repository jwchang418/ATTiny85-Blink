# ATTiny85 Blink
This is a simple code to blind a LED using a MCU called ATTiny85 based on Arduino platform. We assign the PB0 to connect the LED and control its light's on/off. By adjusting the interval time between the light turning on and off, we can observe the LED blinking. Two versions of the code are provided for comparing the Arduino platform and AVR development environment. Arduino makes GPIO pin manipulation easy and clear to demonstrate. On the other hand, AVR demonstrates how the registers function for GPIO pins.
